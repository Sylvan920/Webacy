## Observation

### 1.1 Most Frequently Occurring Risk Tag:

The tag "exploitation" was identified 468 times, making it the most frequently occurring risk tag in the dataset.

### 1.2 Does This Make Sense?:

Yes, this is expected. Exploitation refers to vulnerabilities that can be used by attackers to compromise smart contracts. Given the complex nature of smart contract code, such risks are prevalent and critical.

### 1.3 Typical Handling by Companies:

Security Audits: Companies often conduct thorough security audits of their smart contracts to identify and fix vulnerabilities before deployment.
Bug Bounty Programs: Many organizations implement bug bounty programs to incentivize the community to find and report potential exploits.
Code Reviews and Testing: Rigorous code reviews and extensive testing, including automated tools and manual inspections, are standard practices to mitigate exploitation risks.
Upgradable Contracts: Some companies use upgradable smart contracts to patch vulnerabilities post-deployment.
Best Practices: Following industry best practices for smart contract development and adhering to secure coding guidelines also helps in minimizing exploitation risks.
