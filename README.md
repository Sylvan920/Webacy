# Advanced Frequency Analysis of Smart Contract Risks

## Objective
The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate how to manage large datasets and create dynamic visualizations for analyzing risk tag frequencies in smart contracts. It covers data loading, manipulation, and visualization using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Note
Added an option to use the uploaded `compiled_risk_data.xlsx` file instead of downloading it from Google Drive. If the file already exists in the repository, the download step can be skipped to save time and ensure consistent data usage.
