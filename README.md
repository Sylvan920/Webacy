# Advanced Frequency Analysis of Smart Contract Risks

## Objective
The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate how to manage large datasets and create dynamic visualizations for analyzing risk tag frequencies in smart contracts. It covers data loading, manipulation, and visualization using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Scope

### Data Collection: 
Gathering data related to smart contracts, possibly from blockchain transactions, smart contract code, or security audit reports.

### Risk Identification:
Identifying specific risks associated with smart contracts, such as security vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy attacks, overflow/underflow, gas limit issues), performance issues, or compliance/legal risks.

### Frequency Analysis: 
Analyzing how often each identified risk occurs within a dataset. This could involve statistical analysis to understand the prevalence of different types of risks.

### Reporting: 
Generating reports or visualizations that highlight the most common risks associated with smart contracts, potentially offering insights into areas that need more attention or improvement.

## Note
Added an option to use the uploaded `compiled_risk_data.xlsx` file instead of downloading it from Google Drive. If the file already exists in the repository, the download step can be skipped to save time and ensure consistent data usage.
